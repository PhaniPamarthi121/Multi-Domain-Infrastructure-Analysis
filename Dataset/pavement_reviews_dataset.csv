review
The newly paved road is smooth and easy to drive on.
Cracks appeared on the road after heavy rainfall.
Potholes formed due to poor drainage maintenance.
Surface roughness increased significantly after winter storms.
The asphalt pavement provided a very comfortable ride.
Concrete surface resisted heavy truck loads very well.
Multiple potholes are present in the old highway stretch.
Resurfacing project greatly improved pavement conditions.
Surface shows early signs of fatigue cracking.
Subsurface water erosion led to pavement failures.
High traffic volume caused rutting on the surface.
Sealant was applied to prevent crack propagation.
New concrete overlay enhanced pavement durability.
Freeze-thaw cycles accelerated cracking in the asphalt.
The road was reconstructed using fiber-reinforced concrete.
Pavement shows minimal deformation after high-temperature exposure.
Ride quality degraded due to potholes and cracks.
Resurfaced section exhibits excellent skid resistance.
Flexible pavements are vulnerable to temperature fluctuations.
Rigid pavement showed excellent load distribution.
Traffic loads have initiated minor surface raveling.
Moisture infiltration caused base layer deterioration.
Crack sealing extended pavement service life.
Heavy rainfall triggered structural weakening of the road.
Smooth ride after milling and overlay operation.
