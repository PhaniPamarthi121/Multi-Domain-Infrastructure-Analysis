Class data has six lanes but we have confirmed that there only five lanes in the North direction at the test site location. 0.7 miles North of the test section the highway has an additional (sixth) lane in the North direction. The data is only seven days and it is the only monitored traffic data for 063017 in the LTPP database. This data appears to be part of a separate data collection effort in 2009 for sites with no or very little monitored traffic data. The agency was unable to confirm the source of this data.
