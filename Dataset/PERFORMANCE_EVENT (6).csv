LTPP Change Events with Potential of Affecting Pavement Condition Measurements,Unnamed: 1,Unnamed: 2,Unnamed: 3,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 5
"This document contains a list of LTPP change events with the potential for affecting pavement condition measurements. At present, the change events are limited to manual pavement surface distress, profile (longitudinal and transverse) and deflection testing measurements, and they include data collection guidelines, equipment, and software changes. For each change event, the following information is provided: data category, change event, date, directive, change type, and description. While none of the change events are believed to have affected the LTPP pavement condition measurements, and hence performance trends, they are provided as they could potentially help explain unexpected changes in the pavement condition measurements. Most, but not all, of these change events were documented via LTPP directive, which can easily be found by going to the Operations tab of InfoPave.",,,,,

Distress,LTPP Manual Distress Data Collection Procedures on Asphalt Concrete Pavements,11-Feb-02,D-24,Revised guidelines,"Reviews of 'Reflection Cracking at Joints' data revealed numerous inconsistencies in way cracking has been rated in the past. To address issue, DIM was revised to NOT include reflection cracking. Test sections that had reflection cracking at joints recorded on past surveys were to be changed to 'Longitudinal Cracking' or 'Transverse Cracking'. This issue should have been resolved long ago."

Distress,Distress Measurements on LTPP Asphalt Concrete Test Sections - Surface Defects on Preventive Maintenance Treatments,14-Nov-02,D-29,Revised guidelines,"Surface defects (Bleeding, Polished Aggregate and Raveling) shall not be rated on AC pavements that have received a preventive maintenance treatment covering the original pavement surface such as chip seals, slurry seals, and fog seals. ACP with surface preventive maintenance treatments that exhibit apparent surface defects should be commented on with description of defect and approximate extent. All ACP with surface preventive maintenance treatments that have 'Surface Defects' data recorded on past surveys shall be changed to  'Other' with a description of the defect and approximate extent in square meters. This issue should have been resolved long ago."
